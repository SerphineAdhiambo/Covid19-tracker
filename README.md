# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Analysis and Reporting 📊

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes global COVID-19 trends using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It focuses on cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across selected countries over time.

By the end of this project, you will have a complete data analysis report in a Jupyter Notebook format, including:

- Cleaned and processed data
- Time-based trend analysis
- Comparative visualizations across countries
- Key insights and summary

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Import and clean global COVID-19 data
- ✅ Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations)
- ✅ Compare metrics across countries/regions
- ✅ Visualize trends with line charts and bar graphs
- ✅ Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook report

🧪 Project Steps
Data Collection

Download the dataset from OWID.

Data Loading & Exploration

Load data using pandas and inspect its structure.

Data Cleaning

Filter selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India).

Handle missing values and convert date formats.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize trends over time for cases and deaths.

Compare daily new cases and death rates.

Vaccination Progress

Plot vaccination rollouts.

Compare vaccinated population percentages.

Reporting

Present findings using visualizations and narrative insights.

Export notebook to PDF (optional).

📊 Example Visualizations
Total cases and deaths over time (line chart)

Daily new cases comparison (bar chart)

Vaccination rates by country

(Optional) Choropleth map with plotly

📝 Final Deliverables
✅ A well-documented Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)

✅ Clear and readable visualizations

✅ Markdown cells explaining steps and findings

✅ (Optional) PDF report or slides with screenshots
